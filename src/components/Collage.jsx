        In recent years, the craft industry has faced difficulties due to the
        introduction of modern manufacturing techniques and changing consumer
        preferences. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on
        the export market, resulting in fewer opportunities for the growth of
        the craft. Despite these challenges, efforts have been made by the
        government and cultural organizations to encourage and preserve this
        unique art form. However, many artisans are unaware of these initiatives
        and are often exploited.
